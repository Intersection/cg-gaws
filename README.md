gaws
====

gaws is a go package for working with AWS. gaws has a few goals:

1. Be the most complete AWS package for Go.
2. Be well tested.
3. Be well documented.
4. Be consistent.

gaws is nowhere near ready for real world use, but with your contributions, it can be! Take a look at the Kinesis service for an idea of how to build other gaws packages. Tests should be written with [GoConvey](http://goconvey.co).
